                        /*
                            In javascript there is a fundamental building block called a variable.
                            Think of this as a container that we can put something into. 

                            In this case we are going to create 2 variables image_height and image_width and store the images height and width into it.

                            We declare variables in javascript by using the following syntax

                            var MY_VARIABLE_NAME = "THE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO STORE IN THE VARIABLE";

                            You can store lots of different types of information in a variable, 
                            but for now we'll look at numbers and a string (another name for text) 

                            For numbers you declare a variable

                            var my_num = 1;

                            For strings you delcare a variable, notice the " "

                            var my_string = "This is my string";  

                            When declaring a variable it should not start with a number, should not contain spaces, you can use _ to seperate words.
                            There are also a number of keywords you can't use as variable names.                             

                        */


                        // Delcare a variable called image_height and then use .height() method load the image height into it
                        var image_height = $('.image').height();   

                        // Delcare a variable called image_width and then use the .width() method to load the image width into it
                        var image_width = $('.image').width(); 


                        /*
                            Print out the height and width to the console, we have to join our string 'Image Height' 
                            to our variable image_height, in javascript we use the + sign to do this. 
                        */
                        console.log('Image Height = ' + image_height);  
                        console.log('Image Width = ' + image_width);


                        /*
                          We are using a new jquery statement here called .html() , this gets and sets the content of the selected element.
                          for example $('.my_element').html() will get the content in .my_element
                          $('.my_element').html('hello') will set the content in .my_element to hello


                          We join the string "The height is" to the variable image_height using the + sign again.

                        */
                        $('.height').html('The height is ' + image_height);
                        $('.width').html('The width is ' + image_width);

                
                    });

                    $('.set-size').click(function(event){

                        /*
                            We are setting the image height and width here. 
                            We are doing it a slightly different way using a technique called chaining.

                            It could have been written like
                            $('.image').height('500px');
                            $('.image').width('300px'):

                            But thats a lot of typing! Chaining allows you to put multiple JQuery statements together. 

                        */
                        
                        $('.image').height('500px').width('300px');
        
                    });


                    /*
                      We can capture the form submit event like the click event 
                     */
                    
                    $('#resize-me').submit(function(event){
                        event.preventDefault(); // we don't want the form to submit

                        /*
                           We are going to get the height and width values in the form you just submitted and save them into a variable

                           Our selector is slightly different here, $('#resize-me input[name=height])
                           What it means is 'The HTML element width the id of resize-me (the form) has an element called input with an attribute called height'
                           This is our <input type="text" name="height">. Then we use the JQuery method .val() to get the value of that input box.

                         */
                        
                         var new_height = $('#resize-me input[name=height]').val();
                         var new_width = $('#resize-me input[name=width]').val();

                         console.log('The new width is ' + new_width);

                            so we join the variable with the string 'px' using the +
        
                         */
